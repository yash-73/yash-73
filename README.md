## About

I’m a developer who likes **clean backend logic**, **real-time systems**, and software that behaves predictably under pressure.  
Currently focused on backend-heavy web apps, streaming, and scalable system design.

I care more about *why something works* than stacking buzzwords.

## Tech I Actually Use

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,spring,react,tailwind,mysql,docker,aws,git&theme=dark" />
</p>

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, Hibernate/JPA  
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Databases**: MySQL, Firestore  
- **Infra / Cloud**: AWS (EC2, S3, basic serverless), Docker  
- **Concepts**: Auth flows, real-time communication, scalable APIs

## Selected Projects

### 🎵 Local Music Player (Backend-first)
A local music system with a structured backend API.

- Scans audio files and stores metadata in MySQL  
- Optimized rescans for performance  
- Designed for proper **audio streaming**, not file dumping  
- Backend written with future scalability in mind

**Why it matters**:  
Most “local players” ignore backend design. This doesn’t.

---

### 🧩 Developer Collaboration Platform
A platform to help developers **find projects** and **find contributors**.

- GitHub OAuth authentication  
- Automated repository & contributor management via GitHub API  
- Notifications and tasks using Firestore  
- Spring Boot backend + React frontend

**Lesson learned**:  
Ambition is good. Overcommitting is expensive. Architecture choices matter early.

---

### 💬 Real-Time Systems Experiments
Small but serious experiments involving:

- Peer-to-peer and real-time messaging  
- Event-driven logic  
- Moving away from polling toward push-based systems

Built to understand trade-offs, not chase features.

---

## What I Care About

- Backend correctness > frontend hype  
- Systems that scale **mentally**, not just horizontally  
- Code that future-me won’t curse at  
- Movies, music, photography, and astronomy (useful for staying sane)
